# Scope of Work - Renewable Energy Events Platform

## Quick Overview
Build a simple web app for listing renewable energy events. Users can browse and filter events, organizers can add their own.

## What We're Building

### Frontend (React App)
- **Home Page**: Nav bar, cool hero section, featured events, newsletter signup, footer
- **Login/Register**: One page for both, with forms
- **Events List**: Show events in cards, filter by industry/type
- **Event Details**: Full event info + ad spaces
- **Add Event**: Form to create new events (for logged-in users)

### Backend (Node.js Server)
- User auth (register/login with JWT)
- Events API (get all, add new)
- MongoDB for data storage

## Tech Stuff
- React + Vite for frontend
- Node.js + Express + MongoDB for backend
- JWT for login

## Done When
- All pages work without errors
- Users can login/register
- Events show up, can be filtered
- Organizers can add events
- Looks good on phone/desktop

## Notes
- Uses MongoDB Atlas for database
- No fancy UI libraries, just CSS
- Ready for hosting anywhere
